This is work in progress, come back later (but do come back soon).

This is a multilingual application grammar for casual coffee-break conversations, written in [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org). The grammar generates and parses sentences people can use to talk about themselves and their background, ask and answer questions such as where you live, what you do for a living, whether or not you have family and children, what your likes an dislikes are, and so on. The topics correspond broadly to the kind of stuff students of a foreign language go through at [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) level A1.

Possible applications:

- Simulated dialogue exercises for language learners.
- A conversational wizard that helps you set up a social networking profile or generate a [FOAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)) file.
- Natural-language verbalization of social networking data.
- A chatbot that gets people to divulge personal information about themselves (borderline unethical) or about other people (definitely unethical).

This grammar originated at the [2017 Grammatical Framework Summer School](http://school.grammaticalframework.org/2017/).
